# LeetCodeCracked
a place holder for majority of the questions in leetcode.com
I have been practicing solving various interview questions in leetcode as a fun excercise to getting my mind ready for college recruiting. I figured I could share it with folks who are looking for a job as a reference to their solution.
please make sure that memorizing code will not get you a job, focus on trying it yourself before hand and focus on the approach.
and Good luck.
